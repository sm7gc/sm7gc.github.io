<!-- Introduction -->

<div class="col text-center p-0">
  I am a third-year Ph.D. student studying 
  <a href="https://ist.psu.edu/prospective/graduate/phd-informatics" target="_blank">Informatics</a> in the 
  <a href="https://ist.psu.edu/" target="_blank">College of Information Sciences and Technology</a> at the 
  <a href="https://www.psu.edu/" target="_blank">Pennsylvania State University</a>. 
  My advisor is <a href="https://saeedabdullah.com" target="_blank">Dr. Saeed Abdullah</a> and I work on designing, developing, and deploying novel sensing and intervention systems focusing on health and wellbeing.
  
  <br/><br/>

  Before I joined Penn State, I graduated with 
  a BS in <a href="https://engineering.virginia.edu/departments/computer-science" target="_blank">Computer Science</a> 
  and MS in <a href="https://engineering.virginia.edu/departments/engineering-systems-and-environment/academics/systems-engineering" target="_blank">Systems Engineering</a> from the <a href="https://www.virginia.edu" target="_blank">University of Virginia</a>. 
  For my <a href="https://libraetd.lib.virginia.edu/public_view/xg94hq166" target="_blank">Master's thesis</a>, I proposed a novel framework for constructing rich feature spaces from digital text communications.
